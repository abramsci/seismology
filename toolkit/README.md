# Seismology toolkit to compliment the fresh seismologist education

* A collection of various modules for seismological research.
Mostly intended for personal use and education of students.
**Primarily based on ObsPy - A Python Framework for Seismology.**
Core idea here is to use vast and growing toolkit that is availible now.
NOT to reinvent bike parts - just assemble a custom touring bicycle ^-^

* Works as a repository to test ideas before contributing it elsewhere.

## Enviroment used (~1.5 GB)

``` sh
conda create --name seismology --channel conda-forge python=3.10 obspy pygmt pyasdf constructor
```
